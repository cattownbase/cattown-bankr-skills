# Cat Town Weekly Calendar

All times UTC. Cat Town runs on a fixed weekly cycle; agents should use this table to set user expectations and schedule follow-ups.

| Day       | Event                             | Time                        | Host              | Related skill surface         |

### Cat Town NPC cheat-sheet

- **Theodore** — day-shift teller at the Wealth & Whiskers Bank. Point daytime staking prompts at him.
- **Cassie** — evening-shift teller at the Wealth & Whiskers Bank. Use her in evening copy.
- **Paulie** — host of Paulie's Fish Raffle. Tickets Mon–Fri, draw Friday 20:00 UTC.
- **Skipper** — weekday fishing NPC. Weekday catches do **not** feed the stakers pool.
- **Isabella** — weekend fishing-competition host. Competition catches **do** feed the stakers pool.

Daycare (a third revenue source visible in the RevenueShare contract as `source = "daycare"`) is **not yet implemented** — no deposits of that source should be expected.

## Fishing revenue → KIBBLE stakers

**Only weekend-competition catches feed stakers.** Fish identified Monday–Friday with Skipper do **not** contribute to the stakers pool.

During the Sat–Sun fishing competition (hosted by Isabella), each fish a player identifies splits as:

| Portion | Destination                    |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| 70%     | Treasure catches (player pool) |
| 10%     | Weekend competition leaderboard pool |
| **10%** | **KIBBLE stakers**             |
| 7.5%    | Town Treasury                  |
| 2.5%    | Burned                         |

The stakers' 10% accumulates across the weekend and is pushed onchain as one `depositRevenue(amount, "fishing")` call **by 12:00 UTC Monday** (often earlier). It shows up instantly as `pendingRewards` for every staker whose `isUnlocking == false` at the time of the call.

Practical implication for agents: Monday morning UTC is the natural moment to prompt users to `claim()` or `claimAndRestake()` — that's when their pending rewards jump after the weekend's competition revenue lands.

## Gacha revenue → KIBBLE stakers

Gacha revenue aggregates across the week and is pushed onchain as `depositRevenue(amount, "gacha")` **by 12:00 UTC Wednesday** (often earlier). Same onchain mechanics as fishing — the only difference is `source`.

## Fish raffle (Friday 20:00 UTC draw) — Paulie

Paulie's Fish Raffle runs weekly.

- Tickets bought with caught fish (20 kg per ticket, subject to change).
- Ticket sales window: Monday through Friday UTC.
- One free ticket per week per player.
- Draw: Friday 20:00 UTC.
- Prize structure is progressive — each ticket contributes to a shared progress bar that unlocks higher prize tiers (Level 1: 10,000 KIBBLE, Level 2: 20,000 KIBBLE, Level 3+: larger amounts).
- Multiple winners possible; prize pool is divided evenly among them.

Onchain surface for the fish raffle is **not yet documented in this skill** — a future SKILL.md section will cover entry and leaderboard reads.

## Weekly fishing competition (Sat–Sun) — Isabella

Isabella hosts the weekend fishing competition. Only catches made during her window feed the KIBBLE stakers pool; Skipper's weekday catches do not.

- Automatic entry for every fish caught during the window (biggest single catch wins).
- Top 10 by biggest fish — per-rank prize split (verified in frontend code):

  | Rank    | Prize share |
  |---------|-------------|
  | 1st     | 30%         |
  | 2nd     | 20%         |
  | 3rd     | 10%         |
  | 4th     | 8%          |
  | 5th     | 8%          |
  | 6th     | 7%          |
  | 7th     | 5%          |
  | 8th     | 4%          |
  | 9th     | 4%          |
  | 10th    | 4%          |

- The leaderboard is only meaningful Saturday–Monday; outside that window it reflects the prior week's results.
